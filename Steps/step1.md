# Step-01: Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform

In this step, we use **Terraform** to **provision key infrastructure components**, including a **VPC**, **Security Group**, **Ansible Controller Instance**, and **Jenkins Master and Agent Instances**.  
This approach allows you to automate infrastructure deployment using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles.

## Components Provisioned

1. ### 🏗️ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

   - An isolated, customizable virtual network within your cloud provider.
   - Allows you to define:
     - IP address ranges
     - Subnets
     - Route tables
     - Internet/NAT gateways
   - Helps securely segment and organize cloud resources.

2. ### 🔒 Security Group

   - Acts as a **virtual firewall** for instances within the VPC.
   - Controls **inbound** and **outbound** traffic based on:
     - Protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
     - Port numbers
     - Source and destination IP ranges
   - Enforces strict security policies at the instance level.

3. ### ⚙️ Ansible Controller Instance

   - A dedicated instance configured to run **Ansible**, a powerful IT automation tool.
   - Responsibilities:
     - Manage the configuration and deployment of other instances.
     - Execute **Ansible Playbooks** to automate infrastructure setup and software installation.

4. ### 🛠️ Jenkins Master Instance

   - A centralized **automation server** used for:
     - Managing Jenkins pipelines and jobs.
     - Scheduling and coordinating builds, tests, and deployments.
   - The "Master" orchestrates all automation activities across the environment.

5. ### 🚀 Jenkins Agent Instances

   - Worker nodes connected to the Jenkins Master.
   - Responsibilities:
     - Execute builds, tests, deployments, and other tasks assigned by the Master.
   - Enables **parallel execution** of jobs for faster CI/CD workflows.

## How Terraform Helps

By defining your infrastructure in **Terraform configuration files**:

- You describe your desired state (what infrastructure you need).
- Terraform **automatically provisions** or **updates** resources to match that state.
- Infrastructure changes are **repeatable**, **auditable**, and **scalable**.

## Next Steps (Post-Provisioning)

After the infrastructure is up and running, here’s what to focus on:

1. ### 🔧 Configuration Management with Ansible

   - Use Ansible Playbooks to configure:
     - Jenkins Master and Agent Instances
     - Application dependencies
     - System settings and security hardening
   - Automates repetitive configuration tasks across servers.

2. ### 🔗 Jenkins + Ansible Integration

   - Configure Jenkins to:
     - Trigger Ansible Playbooks after successful builds.
     - Automate deployment pipelines, testing, and system updates.

3. ### 📈 Scaling and Maintenance

   - Define scalable resources in Terraform (e.g., Auto Scaling Groups).
   - Update Terraform configurations as your resource requirements grow.
   - Perform **rolling updates** and **blue-green deployments** with ease.

4. ### 🔍 Monitoring and Security

   - Implement cloud-native or third-party monitoring tools.
   - Set up alerts for critical metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.).
   - Continuously review and tighten security group rules and access policies.

## Best Practices

- **Version Control:** Store your Terraform code in a Git repository to track changes and collaborate effectively.
- **Modularization:** Break your Terraform code into modules for better organization and reuse.
- **State Management:** Secure your Terraform state files (preferably using remote backends like S3 with locking via DynamoDB).
- **Change Review:** Use `terraform plan` to preview infrastructure changes before applying them.
- **Backup:** Regularly back up critical configuration files and states.

✅ **By the end of Step-01, you will have a fully provisioned, automation-ready cloud environment, managed entirely through code.**
